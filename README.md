# Exove Coding Test


## Completed Segments:

### Section 1

#### Segment 1B: CSS-Animated Loader

The loader is a simple CSS animation included as internal CSS, with a separate JavaScript file containing event handlers for changing the loader's speed and appearance. 
Warning: high speed not recommended for photosensitive viewers

#### Segment 1C : React Slider

A simple app built with create-react-app. 
The slider element controls the opacity of a div element, with opacity change triggered on the mouse-up event. 
Running the app:
```
cd ./section1/1C/react-slider && npm install && npm start
```

### Section 2

#### Segment 2B : SQL Query

see ./section2/2B/tables.sql  in repo

#### Segment 2C : HTML errors

see ./section2/2C/htmlErrors.html  in repo

I have improved the consistency and responsivity of heading styles, also removing headings in favor of paragraph elements where appropriate. I have improved accessibility by adding image-alts and correct input labels and modifying tabindex. 


### Section 3

#### Segment 3D : HTML and CSS Layout

A basic HTML page formatted with a responsive CSS grid layout. I have used two breakpoints to reduce grid columns depending on screen size.

See ./section3/3D/index.html
